# AD-Hardening
A repository of scripts to improve the security posture of your On-Prem AD environment

There are two folders, actions and information gathering. As the name implies, actions make changes, information gathering finds relevant information required to make changes. Confirm your information is correct with information gathering scripts prior to running any action scripts. 

I am not responsible for any use of these scripts, please run at your own discretion.
